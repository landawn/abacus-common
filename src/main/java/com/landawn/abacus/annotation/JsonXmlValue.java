/**
 * Indicates that the annotated method or field represents the value of an object
 * for JSON/XML serialization and deserialization purposes. This annotation is used
 * to designate a single property that contains the essential value of the object.
 * 
 * <p>When an object is annotated with this annotation on one of its properties,
 * that property's value will be used as the serialized representation of the entire object.
 * During deserialization, the value will be used to reconstruct the object.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This annotation is particularly useful for:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Wrapper objects that contain a single meaningful value</li>
 *   <li>Value objects where one field represents the primary content</li>
 *   <li>Custom types that need simplified JSON/XML representation</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p><b>Usage Examples:</b></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class Amount {
 *     @JsonXmlValue
 *     private BigDecimal value;
 *     
 *     private String currency; // This won't be serialized as the main value
 *     
 *     public Amount(BigDecimal value, String currency) {
 *         this.value = value;
 *         this.currency = currency;
 *     }
 *     
 *     // When serialized to JSON, only the 'value' field will be used
 *     // Instead of: {"value": 100.50, "currency": "USD"}
 *     // Result will be: 100.50
 * }
 * }</pre>
