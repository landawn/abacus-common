/**
 * Indicates that the annotated method or type uses lazy evaluation strategy.
 * Lazy evaluation defers computation until the result is actually needed,
 * which can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary calculations.
 *
 * <p>When applied to a method, it indicates that the method's computation
 * is deferred until the result is accessed. When applied to a type, it indicates
 * that the entire type or its operations follow lazy evaluation patterns.</p>
 *
 * <p>Lazy evaluation is commonly used in:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Stream operations that don't execute until a terminal operation</li>
 *   <li>Suppliers that compute values on demand</li>
 *   <li>Collections that generate elements as needed</li>
 *   <li>Properties that are calculated when first accessed</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Benefits of lazy evaluation:</b></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Improved performance by avoiding unnecessary computations</li>
 *   <li>Better memory efficiency by processing elements one at a time</li>
 *   <li>Support for infinite data structures</li>
 *   <li>Composition of operations without intermediate results</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Usage Examples:</b></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class DataProcessor {
 *     @LazyEvaluation
 *     public Stream<String> processLargeFile(Path filePath) {
 *         // Returns stream without reading file yet
 *         // File is read only when terminal operation is called
 *         return Files.lines(filePath).map(String::trim);
 *     }
 *
 *     @LazyEvaluation
 *     public Supplier<ExpensiveResult> computeResult() {
 *         // Computation deferred until get() is called
 *         return () -> performExpensiveCalculation();
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * @LazyEvaluation
 * public class LazyList<T> implements List<T> {
 *     // Elements generated on-demand when accessed
 *     private final Function<Integer, T> generator;
 *
 *     public T get(int index) {
 *         return generator.apply(index);  // Computed only when requested
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
