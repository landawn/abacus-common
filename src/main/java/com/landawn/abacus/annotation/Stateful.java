/**
 * Marks a class, method, or field as stateful, indicating that it maintains mutable internal state
 * that can change between invocations or over time. This annotation serves as a warning that the
 * annotated element is not thread-safe and requires careful handling in concurrent environments.
 * 
 * <p>Elements marked with {@code @Stateful} have the following characteristics:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>They maintain internal state that affects their behavior</li>
 *   <li>They are generally not thread-safe without external synchronization</li>
 *   <li>They should not be cached or shared across multiple threads</li>
 *   <li>They may produce different results when called multiple times with the same inputs</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Important considerations:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Do not cache or store stateful objects in shared contexts</li>
 *   <li>Do not access or update stateful objects from multiple threads without synchronization</li>
 *   <li>Consider using thread-local storage or instance-per-thread patterns</li>
 *   <li>Be aware that stateful objects may not be suitable for functional programming patterns. In particular, avoid using stateful objects or interfaces within parallel streams.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p><b>Usage Examples:</b></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * @Stateful
 * public class Counter {
 *     private int count = 0;
 *     
 *     public int increment() {
 *         return ++count;  // Not thread-safe!
 *     }
 * }
 * 
 * @Stateful
 * public Iterator<String> getIterator() {
 *     // Returns a stateful iterator that maintains position
 *     return new FileLineIterator(file);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * @see Immutable
 * @see SequentialOnly
