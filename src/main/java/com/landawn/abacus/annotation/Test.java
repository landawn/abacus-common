/**
 * Marks elements that are intended for testing purposes only and should not be used in production code.
 * This annotation serves as a clear indicator that the annotated element exists solely to support
 * testing infrastructure and may have relaxed access modifiers or special behavior for testability.
 * 
 * <p>Elements marked with {@code @Test} may include:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Methods or constructors with package-private or public access for test access</li>
 *   <li>Fields exposed for test verification</li>
 *   <li>Classes designed as test doubles or mocks</li>
 *   <li>Special test-only implementations</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>This annotation helps maintain clear boundaries between production and test code,
 * making it easier to identify code that should not be used in production contexts.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Example usage:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class UserService {
 *     @Test
 *     void resetForTesting() {
 *         // Method exposed only for test cleanup
 *         cache.clear();
 *         connections.closeAll();
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
