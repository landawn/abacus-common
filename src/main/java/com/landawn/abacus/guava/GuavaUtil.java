    /**
     * Transforms a Range from one comparable type to another using the provided mapping function.
     * This method preserves the bound types (open/closed) of the original range.
     * 
     * <p>The transformation is applied to both the lower and upper bounds of the range (if they exist).
     * The resulting range will have the same bound types as the original:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>If the original has a closed lower bound, the result will have a closed lower bound</li>
     *   <li>If the original has an open upper bound, the result will have an open upper bound</li>
     *   <li>If the original is unbounded (e.g., {@code Range.all()}), the result will also be unbounded</li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * <p>This method is particularly useful when you need to convert ranges of one type to another,
     * such as converting a range of integers to a range of strings, or a range of dates to a range
     * of timestamps.
     * 
     * <p>Example usage:
     * <pre>{@code
     * // Transform a range of integers to a range of strings
     * Range<Integer> intRange = Range.closed(1, 10);
     * Range<String> stringRange = GuavaUtil.transform(intRange, Object::toString);
     * // Result: [1..10] as strings
     * 
     * // Transform a range of dates to timestamps
     * Range<Date> dateRange = Range.closedOpen(startDate, endDate);
     * Range<Long> timestampRange = GuavaUtil.transform(dateRange, Date::getTime);
     * 
     * // Handle unbounded ranges
     * Range<Integer> unbounded = Range.greaterThan(5);
     * Range<Double> doubleRange = GuavaUtil.transform(unbounded, Integer::doubleValue);
     * // Result: (5.0..+âˆž)
     * }</pre>
     *
     * @param <T> the type of the source range elements, must be Comparable
     * @param <U> the type of the target range elements, must be Comparable
     * @param range the source range to transform, must not be null
     * @param mapper the function to transform elements from type T to type U, must not be null
     * @return a new Range with elements of type U, preserving the original range's bound types
