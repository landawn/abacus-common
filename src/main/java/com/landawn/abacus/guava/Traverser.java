/**
 * <p>Note: It's copied from Google Guava under Apache License 2.0 and may be modified.</p>
 * 
 * Provides methods for traversing a graph or tree structure in various orders.
 * This class wraps Google Guava's Traverser functionality and adapts it to work with
 * Abacus Stream API for more convenient iteration.
 * 
 * <p>This class supports two main types of graph structures:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Trees</b>: Directed acyclic graphs where there is at most one path between any two nodes.
 *       Use {@link #forTree(Function)} for better performance with tree structures.</li>
 *   <li><b>General Graphs</b>: May contain cycles and multiple paths between nodes.
 *       Use {@link #forGraph(Function)} for these structures.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Three traversal orders are supported:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Breadth-First</b>: Visits all nodes at depth n before visiting nodes at depth n+1</li>
 *   <li><b>Depth-First Pre-Order</b>: Visits nodes as they are first encountered</li>
 *   <li><b>Depth-First Post-Order</b>: Visits nodes after all their descendants have been visited</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p><b>Usage Examples:</b></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Traverse a file system
 * Traverser<File> fileTraverser = Traverser.FILES;
 * fileTraverser.breadthFirst(new File("/home"))
 *     .filter(File::isFile)
 *     .forEach(System.out::println);
 * 
 * // Create a custom tree traverser
 * Traverser<TreeNode> treeTraverser = Traverser.forTree(node -> node.getChildren());
 * Stream<TreeNode> allNodes = treeTraverser.depthFirstPreOrder(root);
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * @param <T> the type of nodes in the graph
 * @see <a href="http://google.github.io/guava/releases/23.3-android/api/docs/">Guava Documentation</a>

     * A pre-configured traverser for traversing file system directories and files.
     * This traverser treats the file system as a tree where directories are internal nodes
     * and files are leaf nodes.
     * 
     * <p>The traverser uses {@link File#listFiles()} to get children of directories.
     * Files (non-directories) are treated as leaf nodes with no children.
     * If a directory cannot be read, it is treated as having no children.
     * 
     * <p><b>Usage Examples:</b></p>
     * <pre>{@code
     * // Find all .java files in a directory tree
     * Traverser.FILES.breadthFirst(new File("src"))
     *     .filter(f -> f.getName().endsWith(".java"))

     *     .filter(File::isFile)
     *     .mapToLong(File::length)
     *     .sum();
     * }</pre>
