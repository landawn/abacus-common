/**
 * A functional interface for implementing event subscribers in the EventBus system.
 * Classes implementing this interface can be registered with an {@link EventBus} to receive events
 * of the specified type.
 * 
 * <p>This interface is particularly useful for creating subscribers using lambda expressions
 * or anonymous inner classes. When using lambda expressions, the subscriber must be registered
 * with an event ID to avoid ambiguity.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Example usage with lambda expression:</p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * EventBus eventBus = EventBus.getDefault();
 * 
 * // Lambda subscriber for String events
 * eventBus.register((Subscriber<String>) event -> {
 *     System.out.println("Received: " + event);
 * }, "stringEvents");
 * 
 * // Lambda subscriber for custom event types
 * eventBus.register((Subscriber<UserLoginEvent>) event -> {
 *     System.out.println("User logged in: " + event.getUserId());
 * }, "userEvents");
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>Example usage with anonymous inner class:</p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * Subscriber<Integer> numberSubscriber = new Subscriber<Integer>() {
 *     @Override
 *     public void on(Integer event) {
 *         System.out.println("Number received: " + event);
 *     }
 * };
 * eventBus.register(numberSubscriber, "numberEvents");
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>Example usage with method reference:</p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * public class MyHandler {
 *     public void handleString(String message) {
 *         System.out.println("Handling: " + message);
 *     }
 * }
 * 
 * MyHandler handler = new MyHandler();
 * eventBus.register((Subscriber<String>) handler::handleString, "messages");
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * @param <E> the type of event this subscriber will receive
 * @see EventBus
 * @see Subscribe
 * @since 1.0

public interface Subscriber<E> {

    /**
     * Called when an event of type E is posted to the EventBus.
     * This method will be invoked by the EventBus when a matching event is posted.
     * 
     * <p>The method will be called on the thread specified during registration,
     * or on the posting thread if no thread mode was specified.</p>
     * 
     * <p>Implementations should handle the event appropriately and should not throw
     * unchecked exceptions. Any exceptions thrown will be caught and logged by the EventBus.</p>
     * 
     * <p>Example implementation:</p>
     * <pre>
     * {@code
     * public void on(UserEvent event) {
     *     // Process the user event
     *     updateUserInterface(event.getUser());
     *     logUserActivity(event);
     * }
     * }
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param event the event instance posted to the EventBus. Never null.
