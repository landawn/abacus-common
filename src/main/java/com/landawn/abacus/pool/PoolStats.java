/**
 * An immutable record containing statistics about a pool's current state and historical performance.
 * This record provides a snapshot of various metrics that can be used to monitor pool health,
 * performance, and resource utilization.
 * 
 * <p>The statistics include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Capacity and size information</li>
 *   <li>Operation counts (puts, gets)</li>
 *   <li>Cache performance metrics (hits, misses)</li>
 *   <li>Eviction statistics</li>
 *   <li>Memory usage (when applicable)</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p><b>Usage Examples:</b></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * PoolStats stats = pool.stats();
 * 
 * // Calculate hit rate
 * double hitRate = stats.getCount() > 0 ? 
 *     (double) stats.hitCount() / stats.getCount() : 0.0;
 * System.out.println("Cache hit rate: " + (hitRate * 100) + "%");
 * 
 * // Monitor pool utilization
 * double utilization = (double) stats.size() / stats.capacity();
 * System.out.println("Pool utilization: " + (utilization * 100) + "%");
 * 
 * // Check memory usage
 * if (stats.maxMemory() > 0) {
 *     double memoryUsage = (double) stats.dataSize() / stats.maxMemory();
 *     System.out.println("Memory usage: " + (memoryUsage * 100) + "%");
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * @param capacity the maximum number of objects the pool can hold
 * @param size the current number of objects in the pool
 * @param putCount the total number of put/add operations performed
 * @param getCount the total number of get/take operations performed  
 * @param hitCount the number of successful get operations (object was found)
 * @param missCount the number of unsuccessful get operations (object not found or pool empty)
 * @param evictionCount the total number of objects evicted from the pool
 * @param maxMemory the maximum memory size in bytes (-1 if no memory limit)
 * @param dataSize the current total size of data in bytes (-1 if memory tracking is disabled)
