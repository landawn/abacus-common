/**
 * Abstract base class for implementing object pools with eviction, balancing, and memory management capabilities.
 * This class provides the core functionality for thread-safe object pooling including statistics tracking,
 * automatic eviction of idle objects, and memory-based constraints.
 * 
 * <p>The pool maintains various statistics such as hit/miss counts, eviction counts, and memory usage.
 * It uses a ReentrantLock for thread synchronization and condition variables for coordinating
 * producer-consumer interactions.
 * 
 * <p>Key features:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Thread-safe operations with ReentrantLock</li>
 *   <li>Automatic eviction of expired objects based on configurable policies</li>
 *   <li>Memory-based capacity constraints</li>
 *   <li>Statistical tracking of pool operations</li>
 *   <li>Automatic shutdown hook for cleanup</li>
 * </ul>
