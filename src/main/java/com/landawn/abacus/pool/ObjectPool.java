/**
 * A pool of reusable objects that extends the base Pool interface with object-specific operations.
 * This interface provides methods for adding and retrieving objects from the pool with various
 * timeout and cleanup options.
 * 
 * <p>ObjectPool is designed for scenarios where you need to reuse expensive objects like:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Database connections</li>
 *   <li>Thread instances</li>
 *   <li>Large buffers or arrays</li>
 *   <li>Complex initialized objects</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Key features:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Thread-safe add and take operations</li>
 *   <li>Optional timeout support for blocking operations</li>
 *   <li>Automatic destruction of objects that fail to be added</li>
 *   <li>Memory-based capacity constraints via MemoryMeasure</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p><b>Usage Examples:</b></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * ObjectPool<MyPoolable> pool = PoolFactory.createObjectPool(10);
 * 
 * // Add object to pool
 * MyPoolable obj = new MyPoolable();
 * if (!pool.add(obj)) {
 *     obj.destroy(Caller.PUT_ADD_FAILURE);
 * }
 * 
 * // Take object from pool
 * MyPoolable borrowed = pool.take();
 * try {
 *     // use borrowed object
 * } finally {
 *     pool.add(borrowed); // return to pool
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * @param <E> the type of objects in this pool, must implement Poolable
 * @see Pool
 * @see Poolable
 * @see PoolFactory
