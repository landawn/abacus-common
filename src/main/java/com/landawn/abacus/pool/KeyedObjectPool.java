/**
 * A pool that manages objects associated with keys, similar to a Map but with pooling capabilities.
 * This interface extends Pool to provide key-based storage and retrieval of poolable objects.
 * 
 * <p>KeyedObjectPool is useful when you need to pool objects by category or type, such as:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Database connections per schema or server</li>
 *   <li>Thread pools per task type</li>
 *   <li>Cached computations by input parameters</li>
 *   <li>Resources grouped by tenant or user</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Key features:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Map-like interface for key-based access</li>
 *   <li>Automatic expiration of entries based on age or inactivity</li>
 *   <li>Memory-based capacity constraints</li>
 *   <li>Thread-safe operations</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Usage example:
 * <pre>{@code
 * KeyedObjectPool<String, DBConnection> pool = PoolFactory.createKeyedObjectPool(100);
 * 
 * // Store connection by database name
 * DBConnection conn = new DBConnection("server1");
 * pool.put("database1", conn);
 * 
 * // Retrieve connection
 * DBConnection borrowed = pool.get("database1");
 * if (borrowed != null) {
 *     try {
 *         // use connection
 *     } finally {
 *         pool.put("database1", borrowed); // return to pool
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * @param <K> the type of keys maintained by this pool
 * @param <E> the type of pooled values, must implement Poolable
 * @see Pool
 * @see Poolable
 * @see PoolFactory
