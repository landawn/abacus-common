/**
 * Enumeration representing various status states for entities, services, processes, and operations.
 * Each status has an associated numeric code for efficient storage and comparison.
 * 
 * <p>This enum provides a comprehensive set of status values commonly used in applications:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>General account/service/object statuses (ACTIVE, SUSPENDED, EXPIRED, etc.)</li>
 *   <li>Running statuses (STARTED, RUNNING, PAUSED, STOPPED)</li>
 *   <li>Order/process statuses (PREPARING, PROCESSING, PENDING, etc.)</li>
 *   <li>Development statuses (DEVELOPING, TESTING, RELEASED, DEPLOYED)</li>
 *   <li>Privilege statuses (READ_ONLY, UPDATABLE, INSERTABLE, WRITABLE)</li>
 *   <li>State statuses (FROZEN, LOCKED, AVAILABLE, DISABLED, etc.)</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>The status codes are designed to be stored efficiently in databases and provide
 * fast lookups through the {@link #fromCode(int)} method.
 * 
 * <p>Example usage:
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Using status in an entity
 * Status orderStatus = Status.PROCESSING;
 * int statusCode = orderStatus.getCode(); // Returns 42
 * 
 * // Retrieving status from code
 * Status retrieved = Status.fromCode(42); // Returns PROCESSING
 * 
 * // Checking status
 * if (userStatus == Status.ACTIVE) {
 *     // Allow access
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * @see ServiceStatus
