/**
 * A specialized writer for efficient JSON output with automatic character escaping.
 * This class extends CharacterWriter and provides optimized writing of JSON content
 * with proper escaping of special JSON characters according to RFC 4627.
 * 
 * <p>This writer also provides HTML-safe character replacements for environments where
 * JSON may be embedded in HTML contexts. The HTML-safe replacements include escaping
 * for &lt;, &gt;, &amp;, =, and single quotes.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This writer is designed for high-performance JSON generation and automatically
 * handles character escaping to ensure valid JSON output. It provides three modes
 * of operation: internal buffering, writing to an OutputStream, or writing to
 * another Writer.</p>
 * 
 * <p><b>Usage Examples:</b></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * try (BufferedJSONWriter writer = new BufferedJSONWriter()) {
 *     writer.write("{\"name\":\"John");
 *     writer.writeCharacter(" & ");
 *     writer.write("Jane\",\"data\":\"Line1\\nLine2\"}");
 *     String json = writer.toString();
 *     // Result: {"name":"John & Jane","data":"Line1\nLine2"}
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * @see CharacterWriter
 * @since 1.0
