 *
 * A rate limiter. Conceptually, a rate limiter distributes permits at a configurable rate. Each
 * {@link #acquire()} blocks if necessary until a permit is available, and then takes it. Once
 * acquired, permits need not be released.
 *
 * <p>Rate limiters are often used to restrict the rate at which some physical or logical resource
 * is accessed. This is in contrast to {@link java.util.concurrent.Semaphore} which restricts the
 * number of concurrent accesses instead of the rate (note though that concurrency and rate are
 * closely related, e.g., see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law">Little's
 * Law</a>).
 *
 * <p>A {@code RateLimiter} is defined primarily by the rate at which permits are issued. Absent
 * additional configuration, permits will be distributed at a fixed rate, defined in terms of
 * permits per second. Permits will be distributed smoothly, with the delay between individual
 * permits being adjusted to ensure that the configured rate is maintained.
 *
 * <p>It is possible to configure a {@code RateLimiter} to have a warmup period during which time
 * the permits issued each second steadily increase until it hits the stable rate.
 *
 * <p>As an example, imagine that we have a list of tasks to execute, but we don't want to submit
 * more than 2 per second: <pre>   {@code
 *  final RateLimiter rateLimiter = RateLimiter.create(2.0); // rate is "2 permits per second"
 *  void submitTasks(List<Runnable> tasks, Executor executor) {
 *    for (Runnable task : tasks) {
 *      rateLimiter.acquire(); // may wait
 *      executor.execute(task);
 *    }
 *  }}</pre>
 *
 * <p>As another example, imagine that we produce a stream of data, and we want to cap it at 5kb per
 * second. This could be accomplished by requiring a permit per byte, and specifying a rate of 5000
 * permits per second: <pre>   {@code
 *  final RateLimiter rateLimiter = RateLimiter.create(5000.0); // rate = 5000 permits per second
 *  void submitPacket(byte[] packet) {
 *    rateLimiter.acquire(packet.length);
 *    networkService.send(packet);
 *  }}</pre>
 *
 * <p>It is important to note that the number of permits requested <i>never</i> affects the
 * throttling of the request itself (an invocation to {@code acquire(1)} and an invocation to
 * {@code acquire(1000)} will result in exactly the same throttling, if any), but it affects the
 * throttling of the <i>next</i> request. I.e., if an expensive task arrives at an idle RateLimiter,
 * it will be granted immediately, but it is the <i>next</i> request that will experience extra
 * throttling, thus paying for the cost of the expensive task.
 *
 * <p>Note: {@code RateLimiter} does not provide fairness guarantees.

     * This factory method creates a rate limiter with smooth bursty behavior, allowing
     * unused permits to accumulate up to one second's worth.
     *
     * <p>The returned {@code RateLimiter} ensures that on average no more than {@code
     * permitsPerSecond} are issued during any given second, with sustained requests being smoothly
     * spread over each second. When the incoming request rate exceeds {@code permitsPerSecond} the
     * rate limiter will release one permit every {@code

     * {@code permitsPerSecond} permits will be allowed, with subsequent requests being smoothly
     * limited at the stable rate of {@code permitsPerSecond}.
