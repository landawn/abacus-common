 * A functional interface that represents a task to be executed without arguments and

 * Runnable interface while adding exception handling capabilities.
 *
 * <p>This interface is particularly useful in contexts where you need to execute
 * code that may throw checked exceptions, but still want to use it in places that
 * expect a standard {@link java.lang.Runnable}.
 *
 * <p>This is a functional interface whose functional method is {@link #run()}.

     * Executes this runnable task.
     *
     * <p>When an object implementing interface {@code Runnable} is used to create
     * a thread, starting the thread causes the object's {@code run} method to be
     * called in that separately executing thread.
     *
     * <p>The general contract of the method {@code run} is that it may take any
     * action whatsoever. This method performs its task without returning any result
     * and without accepting any parameters.
     *
     * <p><b>Usage Examples:</b></p>
     * <pre>{@code
     * Runnable printTask = () -> System.out.println("Hello, World!");
     * Runnable complexTask = () -> {
     *     System.out.println("Starting task...");
     *     performComplexOperation();
     *     System.out.println("Task completed!");
     * };

     * // Execute directly
     * printTask.run();
     * 
     * // Execute in a thread
     * new Thread(complexTask).start();
     * 
     * // Execute with an executor
     * ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

     * {@code run} method and returns {@code null}. This is useful when you need to
     * submit a runnable task to an {@link java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService} that
     * only accepts {@link Callable} tasks, or when you need to obtain a
     * {@link java.util.concurrent.Future} for a task that doesn't produce a result.

     * <pre>{@code
