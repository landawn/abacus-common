/**
 * Represents an operation on three long-valued operands that produces a long-valued result.
 * This is the three-arity primitive specialization of {@code Function} for long values.
 * 
 * <p>This is a functional interface whose functional method is {@link #applyAsLong(long, long, long)}.
 * 
 * <p>The interface extends {@code Throwables.LongTernaryOperator} with {@code RuntimeException} as the exception type,
 * making it suitable for use in contexts where checked exceptions are not required.
 * 
 * <p><b>Usage Examples:</b></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * LongTernaryOperator sum = (a, b, c) -> a + b + c;
 * long result = sum.applyAsLong(10L, 20L, 30L); // returns 60L
 * 
 * LongTernaryOperator median = (a, b, c) -> {
 *     if ((a >= b && a <= c) || (a <= b && a >= c)) return a;
 *     if ((b >= a && b <= c) || (b <= a && b >= c)) return b;
 *     return c;
 * };
