     * <p>This method consumes four arguments of types A, B, C, and D, performing some
     * side-effect operation without returning any result. Common use cases include
     * updating multiple related objects, logging with multiple parameters, or
     * performing complex state changes that require four inputs.
     *
     * <p><b>Usage Examples:</b></p>
     * <pre>{@code
     * QuadConsumer<String, Integer, Boolean, Date> logger = 
     *     (message, level, isError, timestamp) -> {
     *         System.out.printf("[%s] Level %d %s: %s%n", 
     *             timestamp, level, isError ? "ERROR" : "INFO", message);

     *         orderService.save(order);
     *     };
     * }</pre>

     * @param b the second input argument
     * @param c the third input argument
     * @param d the fourth input argument if the operation cannot be completed

     * operation throws an exception, it is relayed to the caller of the

     * the {@code after} operation will not be performed.

     * <p>This method allows for chaining multiple consumers together, where each
     * consumer receives the same four input arguments. This is useful for performing
     * multiple independent operations on the same set of data.
