 * Represents a function that accepts an int-valued argument and produces a

 * specialization for {@link java.util.function.Function}.
 *
 * <p>This interface extends both {@link Throwables.IntToDoubleFunction} with
 * {@link RuntimeException} and {@link java.util.function.IntToDoubleFunction},
 * providing compatibility with the Java standard library while supporting the

     * <p>Common use cases include:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Converting integer counts or indices to double values for mathematical calculations</li>
     *   <li>Preparing integer data for floating-point arithmetic operations</li>
     *   <li>Converting integer measurements to double for higher precision calculations</li>
     * </ul>
