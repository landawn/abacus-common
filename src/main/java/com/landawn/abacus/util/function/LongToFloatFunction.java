    /**
     * A function that converts a long value to a float value using a simple cast.
     * 
     * <p>This is the default conversion function that preserves the numeric value
     * as closely as possible when converting from long to float. Note that for
     * long values outside the range of float precision (larger than 2^24), there
     * will be loss of precision due to the limitations of float representation.
     * 
     * <p>Example usage:
     * <pre>{@code
     * LongToFloatFunction converter = LongToFloatFunction.DEFAULT;
     * float result = converter.applyAsFloat(42L); // returns 42.0f
     * float largeResult = converter.applyAsFloat(9223372036854775807L); // precision loss occurs
     * }</pre>

    /**
     * Applies this function to the given argument.
     * 
     * <p>Converts a long value to a float value according to the function's implementation.
     * The specific conversion logic depends on the implementation, but common use cases include:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Simple type conversion (casting)</li>
     *   <li>Mathematical transformations with float precision</li>
     *   <li>Scaling operations where float precision is sufficient</li>
     *   <li>Custom business logic requiring float output</li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * <p>Important: When converting from long to float, be aware that float has only
     * 24 bits of precision for the significand, which means that long values requiring
     * more than 24 bits of precision will lose accuracy in the conversion.
     *
     * @param value the function argument as a long
     * @return the function result as a float
