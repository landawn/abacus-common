    /**
     * Performs a one-to-many transformation on the given double value.
     *
     * <p>This method accepts a double value and a consumer, allowing the implementation
     * to push zero or more double values to the consumer. This is particularly useful
     * for operations that may produce multiple outputs from a single input, or may
     * filter out certain inputs by not calling the consumer at all.
     *
     * <p>Common use cases include:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Expanding a single value into multiple values (e.g., generating a sequence)</li>
     *   <li>Conditional mapping where some values produce no output</li>
     *   <li>Flattening nested structures without creating intermediate streams</li>
     *   <li>Implementing custom filtering and transformation logic in one step</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Example usage in a stream:
     * <pre>{@code
     * DoubleStream.of(1.5, 2.5, 3.5)
     *     .mapMulti((value, consumer) -> {
     *         // Generate values from 0.0 to value with step 1.0
     *         for (double i = 0.0; i < value; i += 1.0) {
     *             consumer.accept(i);
     *         }
     *     })
     *     .forEach(System.out::println);
     * // Output: 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0
     * }</pre>
     *
     * @param value the input double value to be transformed
     * @param ic the consumer that accepts the transformed values. The implementation
     *           should call {@code ic.accept(double)} for each output value. May be
     *           called zero or more times
     */
