/**
 * Represents an operation that accepts a single {@code int}-valued argument and returns no result.
 * This is the primitive type specialization of {@link java.util.function.Consumer} for {@code int}.
 * Unlike most other functional interfaces, {@code IntConsumer} is expected to operate via side-effects.
 *
 * <p>This interface extends both {@link java.util.function.IntConsumer} and
 * {@link Throwables.IntConsumer}, providing compatibility with the standard Java functional
 * interfaces while also supporting the Throwables framework.
 *
 * <p>This is a functional interface whose functional method is {@link #accept(int)}.
