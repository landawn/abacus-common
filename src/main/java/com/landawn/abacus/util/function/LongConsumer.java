/**
 * Represents an operation that accepts a single {@code long}-valued argument and
 * returns no result. This is the primitive type specialization of
 * {@link java.util.function.Consumer} for {@code long}. Unlike most other
 * functional interfaces, {@code LongConsumer} is expected to operate via
 * side-effects.
 *
 * <p>This interface extends both {@link Throwables.LongConsumer} with
 * {@link RuntimeException} and {@link java.util.function.LongConsumer},
 * providing compatibility with the Java standard library while supporting the
 * Abacus framework's exception handling capabilities.
 *
 * <p>This is a functional interface whose functional method is
 * {@link #accept(long)}.
 *

     * Performs this operation on the given argument.
     *
     * <p>The consumer processes a long value and performs some side-effect
     * operation. Common use cases include:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Printing or logging long values</li>
     *   <li>Accumulating or aggregating long values</li>
     *   <li>Updating state or counters based on long input</li>
     *   <li>Writing long values to output streams or databases</li>
     *   <li>Triggering actions based on long values (e.g., timestamps)</li>
     *   <li>Collecting statistics from long values</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p><b>Usage Examples:</b></p>
     * <pre>{@code
     * LongConsumer printer = value -> System.out.println("Value: " + value);
     * printer.accept(123456789L); // Prints: Value: 123456789
     *
     * LongStream.range(1, 5).forEach(printer);
     * }</pre>

     * Returns a composed {@code LongConsumer} that performs, in sequence, this
     * operation followed by the {@code after} operation. If performing either
     * operation throws an exception, it is relayed to the caller of the
     * composed operation. If performing this operation throws an exception,
     * the {@code after} operation will not be performed.
     *
     * <p>This method allows for chaining multiple consumers to create a pipeline
     * of operations that will be executed sequentially on the same input value.
     * This is useful for composing complex behaviors from simpler ones.
     *
     * <p><b>Usage Examples:</b></p>
     * <pre>{@code
     * LongConsumer saveToDatabase = value -> database.save(value);
     * LongConsumer logValue = value -> logger.info("Processed: " + value);
     * LongConsumer combined = saveToDatabase.andThen(logValue);
     * combined.accept(12345L); // First saves to database, then logs
