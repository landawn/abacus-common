/**
 * Represents an operation that accepts a {@code long}-valued and an object-valued
 * argument, and returns no result. This is the {@code (long, Object)} specialization
 * of {@link java.util.function.BiConsumer}. Unlike most other functional interfaces,
 * {@code LongObjConsumer} is expected to operate via side-effects.
 *
 * <p>This interface extends {@link Throwables.LongObjConsumer} with
 * {@link RuntimeException}, providing compatibility with the Abacus framework's
 * exception handling capabilities.
 *
 * <p>This is a functional interface whose functional method is
 * {@link #accept(long, Object)}.

     * Performs this operation on the given arguments.
     *
     * <p>The consumer processes a long value and an object value, performing
     * some side-effect operation. This is particularly useful when you need
     * to process a primitive long value alongside an object without boxing
     * the long value.
     *
     * <p>Common use cases include:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Associating long indices or IDs with objects</li>
     *   <li>Processing timestamps (long) with associated data objects</li>
     *   <li>Updating objects based on long values (e.g., setting timestamps)</li>
     *   <li>Recording metrics where the long represents a measurement and the
     *       object provides context</li>
     *   <li>Implementing indexed operations where the long is an index</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p><b>Usage Examples:</b></p>
     * <pre>{@code
     * LongObjConsumer<String> logger = (timestamp, message) -> 
     *     System.out.println("[" + timestamp + "] " + message);
     * logger.accept(System.currentTimeMillis(), "Application started");
     * }</pre>
     *
     * @param i the first input argument (long value)
     * @param t the second input argument (object of type T)

     * Returns a composed {@code LongObjConsumer} that performs, in sequence, this
     * operation followed by the {@code after} operation. If performing either
     * operation throws an exception, it is relayed to the caller of the
     * composed operation. If performing this operation throws an exception,
     * the {@code after} operation will not be performed.
     *
     * <p>This method allows for chaining multiple consumers to create a pipeline
     * of operations that will be executed sequentially on the same pair of
     * input values.
     *
     * <p><b>Usage Examples:</b></p>
     * <pre>{@code
     * LongObjConsumer<User> updateTimestamp = (timestamp, user) -> 
     *     user.setLastModified(timestamp);
     * LongObjConsumer<User> logUpdate = (timestamp, user) -> 
     *     System.out.println("User " + user.getName() + " updated at " + timestamp);
     * 
     * LongObjConsumer<User> combined = updateTimestamp.andThen(logUpdate);
     * combined.accept(System.currentTimeMillis(), user);
     * // First updates the user's timestamp, then logs the update
     * }</pre>
     *
     * @param after the operation to perform after this operation. Must not be null.
     *              Note that the type parameter must be {@code ? super T} to ensure
     *              type safety when composing consumers
