     * 
     * <p>Common use cases include:</p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Mathematical operations (e.g., square, square root, absolute value)</li>
     *   <li>Scaling or normalization (e.g., multiply by constant, convert units)</li>
     *   <li>Rounding or truncation operations</li>
     *   <li>Trigonometric functions</li>
