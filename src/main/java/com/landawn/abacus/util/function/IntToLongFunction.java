     *       exceeding the int range</li>
     *   <li>Converting timestamps or IDs from int to long format</li>
     *   <li>Ensuring compatibility with APIs that require long parameters</li>
     *   <li>Preventing integer overflow in arithmetic operations by converting
     *       to long before calculation</li>
