/**
 * A functional interface that represents an operation that accepts an object-valued argument
 * and a float-valued argument, and returns no result. This is a specialization of BiConsumer
 * for the case where the second argument is a primitive float.
 *
 * <p>This interface is the float primitive specialization of {@link ObjDoubleConsumer}.
 * Unlike the JDK which only provides specializations for int, long, and double primitives,
 * this interface extends support to float primitives for better type safety and performance.
 *
 * <p>This is a functional interface whose functional method is {@link #accept(Object, float)}.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the object argument to the operation
 * @see ObjDoubleConsumer
 * @see java.util.function.BiConsumer

     * Performs this operation on the given arguments.
     *
     * <p>This method consumes an object of type T and a float value, performing some
     * side-effect operation without returning any result. Common use cases include
     * updating the object's state based on the float value, accumulating float values,
     * or performing calculations where the result is stored within the object.
     *
     * <p>Example usage:
     * <pre>{@code
     * ObjFloatConsumer<FloatBuffer> addToBuffer = (buffer, value) -> buffer.put(value);
     * ObjFloatConsumer<Statistics> updateStats = (stats, value) -> stats.addSample(value);
     * }</pre>

     * @param t the first input argument of type T
     * @param value the second input argument, a primitive float value
     * @throws RuntimeException if the operation cannot be completed
