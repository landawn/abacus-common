/**
 * Represents an operation on a single {@code int}-valued operand that produces
 * an {@code int}-valued result. This is the primitive type specialization of
 * {@link java.util.function.UnaryOperator} for {@code int}.
 *
 * <p>This interface extends both {@link Throwables.IntUnaryOperator} with
 * {@link RuntimeException} and {@link java.util.function.IntUnaryOperator},
 * providing compatibility with the Java standard library while supporting the
 * Abacus framework's exception handling capabilities.
 *
 * <p>This is a functional interface whose functional method is
 * {@link #applyAsInt(int)}.
 *
 * <p>Refer to JDK API documentation at: 
 * <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/function/package-summary.html">

     *   <li>Mathematical operations (increment, decrement, negation, absolute value)</li>
     *   <li>Bit manipulation (shifting, masking)</li>
