 * {@code Mutable} is used as a generic interface to the implementations in this package.

 * A typical use case would be to enable a primitive or string to be passed to a method and allow that method to
 * effectively change the value of the primitive/string. Another use case is to store a frequently changing primitive in
 * a collection (for example a total in a map) without needing to create new Integer/Long wrapper objects.
