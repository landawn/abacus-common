/**
 * A utility class for security-related operations.
 * 
 * <p>This class is currently a placeholder for future security functionality.
 * It is designed as a final class with no instantiation to follow the utility class pattern.
 * Future implementations may include methods for:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Cryptographic operations</li>
 *   <li>Password hashing and validation</li>
 *   <li>Token generation and validation</li>
 *   <li>Security checks and validations</li>
 *   <li>Encoding and decoding operations</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>The class uses the NOSONAR comment to suppress SonarQube warnings about
 * the empty class, as it is intentionally left empty for future development.
 * 
 * @since 1.0
