/**
 * An input stream that decompresses data in the LZ4 block format.
 * This class wraps the net.jpountz.lz4.LZ4BlockInputStream to provide
 * LZ4 decompression capabilities with a consistent API.
 * 
 * <p>LZ4 is a fast compression algorithm that provides a good balance between
 * compression ratio and speed. This stream automatically decompresses data that
 * was compressed using LZ4BlockOutputStream or compatible LZ4 block format.</p>
 * 
 * <p><b>Usage Examples:</b></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * try (InputStream compressed = new FileInputStream("data.lz4");
 *      LZ4BlockInputStream lz4In = new LZ4BlockInputStream(compressed)) {
 *     byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
 *     int bytesRead;
 *     while ((bytesRead = lz4In.read(buffer)) != -1) {
 *         // Process decompressed data
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
