/**
 * A high-performance string writer implementation built on StringBuilder.
 * Unlike {@link java.io.StringWriter}, this implementation is NOT thread-safe,
 * trading thread safety for better performance in single-threaded scenarios.
 * 
 * <p>This class extends {@link AppendableWriter} and uses a StringBuilder as its
 * internal buffer. It provides all standard Writer operations plus additional
 * methods for efficient string building.
 * 
 * <p>Key differences from java.io.StringWriter:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Not thread-safe (no synchronization overhead)</li>
 *   <li>Built on StringBuilder for better performance</li>
 *   <li>Provides direct access to the underlying StringBuilder</li>
 *   <li>Returns 'this' from append methods for method chaining</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p><b>Usage Examples:</b></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * StringWriter writer = new StringWriter();
 * writer.append("Hello")
 *       .append(' ')
 *       .append("World!");
 * String result = writer.toString(); // "Hello World!"
 * }</pre>

 * @see AppendableWriter
 * @see java.io.StringWriter
